## ABSTRACT
***
Persistent increase in population of world is demanding more and more oxygen levels in the air 
which made people to maintain plants in their homes. Due to busy life now a days people are 
on a rush in their works which made them difficult to maintain their homes. It is important to 
know moisture levels in soil to maintain its healthy status. Our research work in this paper 
focuses on home-made low cost moisture sensor with accuracy. In this paper we present a 
method to manufacture soil moisture sensor to estimate moisture content in soil hence by 
providing information about required water supply required by telling them the moisture 
content in the soil. This sensor is tested with several samples of soil and able to meet 
considerable accuracy. Measuring soil moisture is an effective way to determine condition of 
soil and get information about the quantity of water that need to be supplied for cultivation. 
Two separate methods are illustrated in this to determine soil moisture in the soil. 
There are three different types of LEDâ€™s and a sound sensor which indicates the user about the 
moisture content in the soil. For blind people, we kept a sound sensor which starts ringing when 
there is low moisture in soil.
